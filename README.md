I'm building a login application with some management features for a personal project. To set it up:

Install Python: If you don't have Python already, download and install it from the official website ().

Install the SQL Connector: Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command: pip install mysql-connector-python (replace mysql-connector-python with the appropriate connector for your database if it's not MySQL).

Configure Database Connection: In your db.py file, replace the placeholder values with your actual database connection details (username, password, hostname, and database name).
Call the database "db".

Start the database and then execute the program (main.py)
